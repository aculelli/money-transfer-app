#Money Transfer App

From the command-line, this app allows a user to register as a new user with a balance of 1000.00. The logged in user can send money to other registered users and view a log of all transactions. Send requests are only permitted if the user has enough balance. When registered or logged in as a different user, the second user can view their balance with any money sent from another user included. They can also view any transactions related to their account number.

Built a web service with an API using the Spring Boot framework. The controller serves up the API endpoints to the 'client', which consumes the API endpoints. RESTTemplate was used to connect the client app to the server, and the JdbcDAO Class uses the query statements to get, put, post, or delete information from the database.
