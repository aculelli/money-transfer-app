#Money Transfer App

From the command-line, this app allows a user to register as a new user with a balance of 1000.00. The logged in user can send money to other registered users and view a log of all transactions. Send requests are only permitted if the user has enough balance. When registered or logged in as a different user, the second user can view their balance with any money sent from another user included. They can also view any transactions related to their account number.
